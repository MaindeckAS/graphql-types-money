# GraphQL::Types::Money

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adHawk/graphql-types-money.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adHawk/graphql-types-money)

Add support for the [Money gem](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money) in GraphQL.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphql-types-money'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install graphql-types-money

## Usage

```ruby
class Types::ProductType < Types::BaseObject
  field :id, ID, null: false
  field :total_price, GraphQL::Types::Money, null: false
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
